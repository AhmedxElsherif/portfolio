## Overview
SmartMed Guardian is an AI-enabled, IoT-capable nursing system that combines continuous patient monitoring with precision automated medication delivery. The system is composed of two cooperating units â€” a **Sensor Unit** for real-time physiological data acquisition, and a **Control Unit** for safe, programmable multi-channel medication administration. Data is synced to the cloud for remote monitoring and control.

## System Architecture

### Sensor Unit (Patient Monitoring Module)
- Continuously captures vitals: ECG, heart rate, SpOâ‚‚, blood pressure, respiratory rate, glucose readings, and body temperature.
- Uses medical-grade sensors (MAX30102, AD8232, MPX5050DP) and inertial sensing (MPU6050) for motion/respiratory analysis.
- Local pre-processing and secure transmission to the cloud via Wi-Fi (ESP32-S3).
- Emergency alert button for immediate local alarm and remote notification.

### Control Unit (Medication Administration Module)
- Controls up to **5 independent peristaltic pumps** for liquid medication delivery.
- Implements safety checks: current monitoring (ACS712), flow verification (YF-S201), fluid level detection, and optical isolation.
- Receives schedules and dosing commands from the cloud dashboard; supports manual overrides and emergency stop.
- Battery backup and redundant protections to ensure uninterrupted operation.
